Potential methods include a double radation call, once with and once without the stratospheric aerosols, and also the use feedback methods.\nSimulations to be conducted as if the aerosols or aerosol precursors are emitted in a line from 10\u00b0S to 10\u00b0N along a single longitude band (0\u00b0).  The injected aerosols or aerosol precursors should be evenly spread across model layers between 18 and 20 km.  Note that sedimentation processes and self-lofting due to heating are likely to result in the aerosols being distributed between 16-25 km in altitude.", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.designing.ForcingConstraint", "canonicalName": "stratAerPreRCP85extover-RCP45internal", "name": "StratAerPreRCP85extovertoRCP45Internal", "meta": {"language": "en", "author": {"version": 1, "uid": "253825f3-fbc8-43fb-b1f6-cc575dc693eb", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.DocReference"}, "institute": "--", "createDate": "2016-07-01 15:14:57.628063", "project": "cmip6-draft", "source": "spreadsheet", "version": 1, "updateDate": "2016-07-01 15:14:57.628063", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.DocMetaInfo", "type": "cim.2.designing.ForcingConstraint", "id": "b91cfbec-86e2-4a8d-9e6b-6f78f8e80935"}, "references": [{"version": 1, "type": "cim.2.shared.Citation", "id": "9e139643-3060-4b5b-9869-269f6d66c19b", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.DocReference"}, {"version": 1, "type": "cim.2.shared.Citation", "id": "7502f8a5-a59a-4706-a1a4-3f361ba15d96", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.DocReference"}, {"version": 1, "type": "cim.2.shared.Citation", "id": "fe3dba69-5cd0-4c42-a111-bacd0ceca9d4", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.DocReference"}], "longName": "Stratospheric aerosol precursor injection to reduce RCP8.5ext overforcing to RCP4.5 levels, internal aerosol treatment", "keywords": "GeoMIP, sulfate mitigation, SSP5-85extover to SSP2-45, internal aerosol treatment, stratospheric aerosol precursor injection", "isConformanceRequested": true, "forcingType": "scenario"}
