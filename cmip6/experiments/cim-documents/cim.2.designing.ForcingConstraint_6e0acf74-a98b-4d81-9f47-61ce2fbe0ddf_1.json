{"description": "Decrease in forest area and increase in natural grassland from pre-industrial. 20 million square km forest area (covered by trees) is converted to natural unmanaged grassland over a period of 50 years with a linear rate of 400000 km2/yr followed by 30 years of constant forest cover.  Deforestation should be restricted to the top 30% of land grid cells in terms of their area of tree cover.  Effectively this concentrates deforestation in the tropical rainforest and boreal forest regions.  The replacement of forest with natural grassland should be done in such a way that carbon (and nitrogen if applicable) from the forested soil is maintained and allowed to evolve according to natural model processes.  If initial forest cover is less than 20 million square km then linearly remove all the forested area over 50 years and report the total area of forest removed.", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.designing.ForcingConstraint", "canonicalName": "IdealisedDeforestation", "name": "Idealised Deforestation from Forest to Grassland", "parties": [{"party": ["George Hurtt", "David Lawrence"], "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.Responsibility"}], "citations": [{"version": 1, "type": "cim.2.shared.Citation", "id": "160a1b64-b98b-41df-b339-6011febe5971", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.DocReference"}, {"version": 1, "type": "cim.2.shared.Citation", "id": "cc51b1e6-afbe-45df-8c84-321b37456568", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.DocReference"}], "meta": {"language": "en", "author": {"version": 1, "uid": "253825f3-fbc8-43fb-b1f6-cc575dc693eb", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.DocReference"}, "institute": "--", "createDate": "2016-07-04 13:00:00", "project": "cmip6-draft", "source": "spreadsheet", "version": 1, "updateDate": "2016-07-04 13:00:00", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.DocMetaInfo", "type": "cim.2.designing.ForcingConstraint", "id": "6e0acf74-a98b-4d81-9f47-61ce2fbe0ddf"}, "rationale": "Idealized deforestation has the advantage that it will be easier to ensure conformity across models in terms of the land cover change.", "longName": "Idealised linear deforestation from forest to unmanaged grassland", "keywords": "LUMIP, idealised deforestation, 20 million square km per year.", "isConformanceRequested": false, "forcingType": 1}
