The first tier contains four scenarios, while the second tier contains an overshoot scenario in which a peak in radiative forcing occurs in the 21st century, additional ensemble members for one of the 21st century scenarios, and three long-term extensions that begin from the end points of two of the 21st century scenarios and extend to 2300. The third tier proposes an additional low scenario, with details yet to be defined.", "meta": {"language": "en", "author": {"version": 1, "uid": "253825f3-fbc8-43fb-b1f6-cc575dc693eb", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.DocReference"}, "institute": "--", "createDate": "2016-07-04 13:00:00", "project": "cmip6-draft", "source": "spreadsheet", "version": 1, "updateDate": "2016-07-04 13:00:00", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.DocMetaInfo", "type": "cim.2.shared.Citation", "id": "838ebf11-b1fc-4d58-a6e8-6fd073f0bb04"}, "context": "The experimental design of the Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) consists of seven 21st-century scenarios.", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.Citation"}
