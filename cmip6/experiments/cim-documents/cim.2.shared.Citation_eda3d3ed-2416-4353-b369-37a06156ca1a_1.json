It has been proven challenging in previous CMIP exercises to model, isolate and understand the effect of aerosol\u2010climate interactions. Dedicated experiments and diagnostics are thus foreseen in CMIP6, in particular in the MIPs AerChemMIP, RFMIP, PDRMIP, ScenarioMIP, DAMIP. A challenge for modelling groups is to decide whether interactive aerosol components are included in the model or whether aerosol forcing fields are read and used. Also consistent DECK and MIP simulations need to be achieved. AerChemMIP has been given the task by the CMIP panel to provide aerosol forcing fields. This document describes several options for modelling groups and invites for feedback by modelling groups, wishing to use such aerosol forcing fields.", "meta": {"language": "en", "author": {"version": 1, "uid": "253825f3-fbc8-43fb-b1f6-cc575dc693eb", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.DocReference"}, "institute": "--", "createDate": "2016-07-04 13:00:00", "project": "cmip6-draft", "source": "spreadsheet", "version": 1, "updateDate": "2016-07-04 13:00:00", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.DocMetaInfo", "type": "cim.2.shared.Citation", "id": "eda3d3ed-2416-4353-b369-37a06156ca1a"}, "context": "Aerosol forcing fields for CMIP6", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.Citation"}
