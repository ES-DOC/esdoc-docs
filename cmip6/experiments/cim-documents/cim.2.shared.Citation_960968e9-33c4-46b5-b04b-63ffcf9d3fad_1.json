Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the tropical North Atlantic (TNA) region critical for hurricanes (10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0N) were at record high levels in the extended summer (June to October) of 2005 at 0.9\u00b0C above the 1901\u201370 normal and were a major reason for the record hurricane season. Changes in TNA SSTs are associated with a pattern of natural variation known as the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO). However, previous AMO indices are conflated with linear trends and a revised AMO index accounts for between 0 and 0.1\u00b0C of the 2005 SST anomaly. About 0.45\u00b0C of the SST anomaly is common to global SST and is thus linked to global warming and, based on regression, about 0.2\u00b0C stemmed from after-effects of the 2004\u201305 El Ni\u00f1o.", "meta": {"language": "en", "author": {"version": 1, "uid": "253825f3-fbc8-43fb-b1f6-cc575dc693eb", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.DocReference"}, "institute": "--", "createDate": "2016-07-04 13:00:00", "project": "cmip6-draft", "source": "spreadsheet", "version": 1, "updateDate": "2016-07-04 13:00:00", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.DocMetaInfo", "type": "cim.2.shared.Citation", "id": "960968e9-33c4-46b5-b04b-63ffcf9d3fad"}, "context": "Atlantic hurricanes and natural variability in 2005", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.Citation"}
