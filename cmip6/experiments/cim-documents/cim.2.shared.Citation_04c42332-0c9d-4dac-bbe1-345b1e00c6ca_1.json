A minimal set of requirements is imposed to simplify and accelerate the set-up of the required simulations. The interannual simulations will be carried out during the period 1948-2002. There are no restrictions on the biological and carbon models that are used in these simulations, other than that they must be prognostic. For instance, the diagnostic, nutrient-restoring approaches (e.g., that used in OCMIP-2) is not appropriate for interannual studies and should not be used by any participants. All output files will be provided in standard NetCDF format.", "meta": {"language": "en", "author": {"version": 1, "uid": "253825f3-fbc8-43fb-b1f6-cc575dc693eb", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.DocReference"}, "institute": "--", "createDate": "2016-07-01 15:14:57.651556", "project": "cmip6-draft", "source": "spreadsheet", "version": 1, "updateDate": "2016-07-01 15:14:57.651556", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.DocMetaInfo", "type": "cim.2.shared.Citation", "id": "04c42332-0c9d-4dac-bbe1-345b1e00c6ca"}, "context": "OCMIP3 biogeochemical web guide", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.Citation"}
