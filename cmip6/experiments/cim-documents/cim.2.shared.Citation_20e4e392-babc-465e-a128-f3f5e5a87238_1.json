Much effort is put into measuring and constraining TCRE - the Transient Climate Response to cumulative carbon Emissions - but also required is parallel information on the ZEC which quantifies the subsequent temperature change following cessation of emissions. Both are required to relate carbon emissions to the eventual warming. Lack of literature on near-term ZEC led IPCC Special Report on 1.5 degrees to assume for the estimation of carbon budgets that ZEC was zero. But evidence exists that ZEC can be (a) non-zero; (b) both state and rate dependent. When we consider very low climate targets, such as 1.5 or 2 degrees a small uncertainty in ZEC (of even just 0\u00b10.1oC) leads to a very substantial fractional uncertainty in the remaining carbon budget.", "meta": {"author": {"version": 1, "meta": {"type": "cim.2.shared.DocReference"}, "uid": "253825f3-fbc8-43fb-b1f6-cc575dc693eb"}, "createDate": "2017-03-21 00:00:00", "project": "cmip6", "source": "spreadsheet", "version": 1, "updateDate": "2017-03-21 00:00:00", "type": "cim.2.shared.Citation", "id": "20e4e392-babc-465e-a128-f3f5e5a87238"}, "context": "Quantifying the Zero Emissions Commitment"}
