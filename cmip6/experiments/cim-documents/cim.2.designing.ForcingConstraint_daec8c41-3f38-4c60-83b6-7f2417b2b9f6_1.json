{"description": "As a best estimate for the impact of electron precipitation we recommend the use of parameterisations based on geomagnetic activity indices such as the Kp- or Ap-index to describe ionisation from electron precipitation in the lower thermosphere and upper mesosphere (for those models that explicitly include those height levels in their code).\nFor lower top models (models with upper limit in the mesosphere) auroral production of NOx and the subsequent descent from higher altitudes to the model domain is commonly described by a semi-empirical upper boundary condition in function of Ap. An updated Ap-based parametrization, based on recent satellite observations (Funke et al., 2014a,b), will be made available.", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.designing.ForcingConstraint", "canonicalName": "HistoricalElectronForcing", "name": "Historical Electron Forcing", "parties": [{"party": ["Bernd Funke", "Katja Matthes"], "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.Responsibility"}], "citations": [{"version": 1, "type": "cim.2.shared.Citation", "id": "837cdf84-1de7-47b1-81a2-9811a5ee077e", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.DocReference"}], "meta": {"language": "en", "author": {"version": 1, "uid": "253825f3-fbc8-43fb-b1f6-cc575dc693eb", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.DocReference"}, "institute": "--", "createDate": "2016-07-04 13:00:00", "project": "cmip6-draft", "source": "spreadsheet", "version": 1, "updateDate": "2016-07-04 13:00:00", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.DocMetaInfo", "type": "cim.2.designing.ForcingConstraint", "id": "daec8c41-3f38-4c60-83b6-7f2417b2b9f6"}, "rationale": "Precipitating energetic particles from the sun (predominantly protons) and the magnetosphere (predominantly electrons) provide an additional pathway of solar forcing .
