It remains unclear, however, to what extent the proposed aerosol-induced changes reflect robust model behavior or are affected by uncertainties in the models\u2019 treatment of physical processes, most notably those related to moist phenomena. \u201cEasy Aerosol\u201d addresses these questions by subjecting comprehensive atmosphere general circulation models to the same set of idealized \u201ceasy\u201d aerosol perturbations that are designed based on a global aerosol climatology and mimic the gravest mode of the anthropogenic aerosol. This document discusses the motivation of Easy Aerosol, describes the aerosol perturbations, and defines the experimental protocol.", "meta": {"language": "en", "author": {"version": 1, "uid": "253825f3-fbc8-43fb-b1f6-cc575dc693eb", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.DocReference"}, "institute": "--", "createDate": "2016-07-01 15:14:57.652050", "project": "cmip6-draft", "source": "spreadsheet", "version": 1, "updateDate": "2016-07-01 15:14:57.652050", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.DocMetaInfo", "type": "cim.2.shared.Citation", "id": "98a206cc-55ed-45a6-b8a8-3039e44b9bc6"}, "context": "A modeling framework to study robustness and sources of uncertainties in aerosol-induced changes of the large-scale atmospheric circulation.", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.Citation"}
