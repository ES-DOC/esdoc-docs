All scenarios should be compared to the input4MIPS SSP245 baseline https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/input4mips/\nFour scenarios are given for departures from the SSP245 baseline. The baseline is also provided for convenience. Scenarios depart after the start of 2020. Monthly concentrations of CO2, CH4 and N2O are provided over 2015-2050. For short-lived species emissions are provided for BC, CO, OC, SO2, NH3, NOx, & NMVOCs. Monthly values for years:2015,2019,2020,2021,2023,2030,2040 and 2050 are provided for the four scenarios and baseline. The SSP245 baseline is also available from the input4MIPS website. \nNOx emissions from aviation is provided in monthly values for years:2015,2019,2020, 2021, 2022, 2023,2030,2040 and 2050. \nWell-mixed greenhouse gas emissions are provided for North, South and global average concentration of CO2, CH4 and N2O for all months 2015-2050.", "meta": {"author": {"version": 1, "meta": {"type": "cim.2.shared.DocReference"}, "uid": "253825f3-fbc8-43fb-b1f6-cc575dc693eb"}, "createDate": "2017-03-21 00:00:00", "project": "cmip6", "source": "spreadsheet", "version": 1, "updateDate": "2017-03-21 00:00:00", "type": "cim.2.shared.Citation", "id": "60df1e33-39a1-4454-a1da-2dfe90a63f60"}, "context": "Emissions and climate effects due to the COVID-19 response"}
