The DCPP makes use of past experience in simulating and predicting decadal variability and forced climate change gained from CMIP5 and elsewhere. It builds on recent improvements in models, in the reanalysis of climate data, in methods of initialization and ensemble generation, and in data treatment and analysis to propose an extended comprehensive decadal prediction investigation as part of CMIP6. The DCPP consists of three Components. Component A comprises the production and analysis of an extensive archive of retrospective forecasts to be used to assess and understand historical decadal prediction skill, as a basis for improvements in all aspects of end-to- end decadal prediction, and as a basis for forecasting on annual to decadal timescales. Component B undertakes ongoing production, dissemination and analysis of experimental quasi-real-time multi-model forecasts as a basis for potential operational forecast production. Component C involves the organization and coordination of case studies of particular climate shifts and variations, both natural and naturally forced (e.g. the \u201chiatus\u201d, volcanoes), including the study of the mechanisms that determine these behaviours. Groups are invited to participate in as many or as few of the Components of the DCPP, each of which are separately prioritized, as are of interest to them.
