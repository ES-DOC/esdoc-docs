When this Inter-decadal Pacifc Oscillation (IPO) raises temperatures in the tropical Pacifc Ocean, there is no robust relationship between year-to-year Australian climate variations and ENSO. When the IPO lowers temper- ature in the same region, on the other hand, year-to-year ENSO variability is closely associated with year-to-year variability in rainfall, surface temperature, river flow and the domestic wheat crop yield. The contrast in ENSO's influence between the two phases of the IPO is quite remarkable. This highlights exciting new avenues for obtaining improved climate predictions.", "meta": {"author": {"version": 1, "meta": {"type": "cim.2.shared.DocReference"}, "uid": "253825f3-fbc8-43fb-b1f6-cc575dc693eb"}, "createDate": "2017-03-21 00:00:00", "project": "cmip6", "source": "spreadsheet", "version": 1, "updateDate": "2017-03-21 00:00:00", "type": "cim.2.shared.Citation", "id": "7c46a901-a9e4-409d-97da-92fb918c5916"}, "context": "Interdecadal modulation of the impact of ENSO on Australia"}
