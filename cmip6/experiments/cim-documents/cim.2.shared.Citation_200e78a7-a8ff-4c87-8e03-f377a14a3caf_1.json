Observed monthly mean SSTs and sea ice concentration have been compiled for the period January 1870 through near present. This data set will be updated periodically (at least every 6 months). These observed monthly means do not constitute the AMIP II boundary conditions, but the boundary conditions are based on them, as explained in this brief report. The original AMIP II period extended from January 1979 through February 1996, but simulations need not be strictly limited to this period. We therefore routinely distribute the observed data for the full period available.", "meta": {"language": "en", "author": {"version": 1, "uid": "253825f3-fbc8-43fb-b1f6-cc575dc693eb", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.DocReference"}, "institute": "--", "createDate": "2016-07-04 13:00:00", "project": "cmip6-draft", "source": "spreadsheet", "version": 1, "updateDate": "2016-07-04 13:00:00", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.DocMetaInfo", "type": "cim.2.shared.Citation", "id": "200e78a7-a8ff-4c87-8e03-f377a14a3caf"}, "context": "AMIP sea surface temperature and sea ice concentration boundary conditions", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.Citation"}
