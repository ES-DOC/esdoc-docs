The rise in Atlantic tropical sea surface temperatures extends eastward the breeding ground of tropical cyclones, yielding more frequent and intense hurricanes following pathways directed toward Europe. En route they transform into extratropical depressions and reintensify after merging with the midlatitude baroclinic unstable flow. Our model simulations clearly show that future tropical cyclones are more prone to hit western Europe, and do so earlier in the season, thereby increasing the frequency and impact of hurricane force winds.", "meta": {"language": "en", "author": {"version": 1, "uid": "253825f3-fbc8-43fb-b1f6-cc575dc693eb", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.DocReference"}, "institute": "--", "createDate": "2016-07-01 15:14:57.651022", "project": "cmip6-draft", "source": "spreadsheet", "version": 1, "updateDate": "2016-07-01 15:14:57.651022", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.DocMetaInfo", "type": "cim.2.shared.Citation", "id": "055c1db2-a7f2-4b10-814b-0cd9c07b4573"}, "context": "More hurricanes to hit Western Europe due to global warming", "ontologyTypeKey": "cim.2.shared.Citation"}
