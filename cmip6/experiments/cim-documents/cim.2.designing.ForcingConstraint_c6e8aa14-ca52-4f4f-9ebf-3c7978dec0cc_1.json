Note that the amount of sulfate injection needed for a given model to achieve the goals of this experiment may vary, so modeling groups should scale the aerosol and ozone perturbation fields as necessary.\nSimulations to be conducted as if the aerosols or aerosol precursors are emitted in a line from 10\u00b0S to 10\u00b0N along a single longitude band (0\u00b0).  The injected aerosols or aerosol precursors should be evenly spread across model layers between 18 and 20 km.  Note that sedimentation processes and self-lofting due to heating are likely to result in the aerosols being distributed between 16-25 km in altitude.", "canonicalName": "stratAerPreRCP85extover-RCP45external", "name": "StratAerPreRCP85extovertoRCP45External", "citations": [{"meta": {"type": "cim.2.shared.DocReference"}, "type": "cim.2.shared.Citation", "version": 1, "id": "9e139643-3060-4b5b-9869-269f6d66c19b"}, {"meta": {"type": "cim.2.shared.DocReference"}, "type": "cim.2.shared.Citation", "version": 1, "id": "15d69e89-9f99-4278-ada4-f11305bf301b"}, {"meta": {"type": "cim.2.shared.DocReference"}, "type": "cim.2.shared.Citation", "version": 1, "id": "7502f8a5-a59a-4706-a1a4-3f361ba15d96"}, {"meta": {"type": "cim.2.shared.DocReference"}, "type": "cim.2.shared.Citation", "version": 1, "id": "fe3dba69-5cd0-4c42-a111-bacd0ceca9d4"}], "meta": {"author": {"version": 1, "meta": {"type": "cim.2.shared.DocReference"}, "uid": "253825f3-fbc8-43fb-b1f6-cc575dc693eb"}, "createDate": "2016-07-04 13:00:00", "project": "cmip6-draft", "source": "spreadsheet", "version": 1, "updateDate": "2016-07-04 13:00:00", "type": "cim.2.designing.ForcingConstraint", "id": "c6e8aa14-ca52-4f4f-9ebf-3c7978dec0cc"}, "longName": "Stratospheric aerosol precursor injection to reduce RCP8.5extover forcing to RCP4.5 levels, external aerosol treatment", "keywords": "GeoMIP, sulfate mitigation, SSP5-85extover to SSP2-45, external aerosol data input, stratospheric aerosol precursor injection", "scope": "experiment", "isConformanceRequested": true, "deliveryOrder": "post-simulation", "forcingType": "scenario"}
