We first describe core datasets that we are committed to providing by Fall 2015 (October) for use by atmospheric chemistry models to produce historical concentration fields. Potential refinements to this data that may be possible by this time will be described separately. Priority for these will be set depending on community feedback.", "meta": {"author": {"version": 1, "meta": {"type": "cim.2.shared.DocReference"}, "uid": "253825f3-fbc8-43fb-b1f6-cc575dc693eb"}, "createDate": "2017-03-21 00:00:00", "project": "cmip6-draft", "source": "spreadsheet", "version": 1, "updateDate": "2017-03-21 00:00:00", "type": "cim.2.shared.Citation", "id": "ba024e25-bce6-46d9-a321-5eaa77d75903"}, "context": "Historical emissions for CMIP6"}
