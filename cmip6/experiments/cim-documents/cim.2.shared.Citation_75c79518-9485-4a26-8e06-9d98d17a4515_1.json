{"abstract": "Sea surface temperature and sea ice concentration at daily temporal resolution and 1/4 degree horizontal resolution.  Gradients in SST associated with fronts and ocean eddies can have significant influence on the atmosphere via changes in air-sea fluxes. Similarly, there is evidence that daily variability rather than monthly smoothed forcing can influence model simulations.", "meta": {"author": {"version": 1, "meta": {"type": "cim.2.shared.DocReference"}, "uid": "253825f3-fbc8-43fb-b1f6-cc575dc693eb"}, "createDate": "2016-07-04 13:00:00", "project": "cmip6-draft", "source": "spreadsheet", "version": 1, "updateDate": "2016-07-04 13:00:00", "type": "cim.2.shared.Citation", "id": "75c79518-9485-4a26-8e06-9d98d17a4515"}, "context": "Sea surface temperature and sea ice concentration at daily temporal resolution and 1/4 degree horizontal resolution.", "citationDetail": "Rayner, N.
