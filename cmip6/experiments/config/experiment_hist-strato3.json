Tropospheric ozone should be fixed at 3D long-term monthly mean piControl values, with grid cells having an ozone concentration below 100 ppbv in the piControl climatology for a given month classed as tropospheric.\nIn models without coupled chemistry the same stratospheric ozone prescribed in CMIP6 historical experiment should be prescribed.",
