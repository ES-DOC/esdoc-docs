    "description": "Bell-shape zero emissions experiment. Run in emissions-driven configuration with CO2-only forcing, all non-CO2 forcing is fixed at pre-industrial levels. Use a bell-shaped CO2 emissions profile designed to give cumulative emissions of 1000 PgC after 100 years.  Then hold CO2 emissions at zero and simulate the subsequent reduction in CO2 and change in climate for at least 100 years (1000 years for EMICs).  The time series of global CO2 for the bell-shape emission profiles will be provided by ZECMIP via the C4MIP and CDRMIP websites.  A model decision is required on the spatial pattern of CO2 emissions, ZECMIP suggest globally uniform at surface.",
