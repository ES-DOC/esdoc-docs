    "description": "The Carbon Dioxide Removal Model Intercomparison Project (CDR-MIP) brings together models of the Earth system in a common framework to explore the potential, impacts, and challenges of CDR. CDR-MIP experiments are designed to address questions concerning CDR-induced climate \"reversibility\", the response of the Earth system to direct atmospheric CO2 removal (direct air capture and storage), and the CDR potential of proposed schemes such as afforestation/reforestation and ocean alkalinization.",
