    "description": "The Aerosol Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP) is endorsed by the Coupled-Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) and is designed to quantify the climate and air quality impacts of aerosols and chemically-reactive gases. These are specifically near-term climate forcers (NTCFs: methane, tropospheric ozone and aerosols, and their precursors), nitrous oxide and ozone-depleting halocarbons.",

How have anthropogenic emissions contributed to global radiative forcing and affected regional climate over the historical period?\n2.            How might future policies (on climate, air quality and land use) affect the abundances of NTCFs and their climate impacts?\n3.            How do uncertainties in historical NTCF emissions affect radiative forcing estimates?\n4.            How important are climate feedbacks to natural NTCF emissions, atmospheric composition, and radiative effects?",
