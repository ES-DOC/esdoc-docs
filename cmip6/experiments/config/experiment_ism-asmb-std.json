Apply a prescribed SMB anomaly, provided by ISMIP6,  which mimics the expected SMB change from the end of the 20th century to the end of the 21st century. All other model parameters and forcings are the same as those used for initialization.\nNeither SMB anomaly nor bedrock topography should be adjusted in response to ice-sheet geometric changes in this experiment. However, groups are encouraged to submit multiple \"physics\" ensemble members for example by changing the sliding law, stress balance approximation, model resolution, or datasets (such as using different bedrocks).",
