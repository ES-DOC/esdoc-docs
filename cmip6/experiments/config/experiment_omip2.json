    "description": "Global ocean - sea-ice - coupled experiment forced with the JRA55-do inter-annually varying atmospheric and river data sets for years 1958-2018. Initial ocean tracer fields are based on observations. Simulation length for at least 6 cycles of the 61-year forcing is required.  The 6-cycle length is recommended to facilitate intercomparison within the experiment by using a common simulation length, but a longer simulation length is also accepted. In each simulation, set the beginning of the simulation (e.g., 1653 for the 6-cycle simulation) as the \u2018base time\u2019 of the time axis.\nSimulations with different simulation lengths by a single model are treated as members\nof an ensemble. Thus, different 'realization' indexes (e.g., r1, r2, r3, ...) should be used\nin a global attribute named 'variant_index' (e.g., r1i1p1f1). \nIt is requested that information relevant to understanding the differences in members of \nan ensemble of simulations is reported in a global attribute named 'variant_info'.  This information should also be recorded in the ES-DOC documentation of each experiment performed by a model and be made available via the 'further_info_url'.\nAll Priority=1 OMIP diagnostics are requested for the all cycles of the 61-year forcing\nto quantify drift. All OMIP diagnostics (Priority=1,2,3) are requested for the last cycle.",
