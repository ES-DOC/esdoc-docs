Use the 4 x CO2 restart from the 1pctCO2 simulation and prescribe a 1% per year removal of CO2 from the atmosphere  (start removal at the beginning of the 140th year on 1 January)  until the CO2 concentration reaches 284.7 ppm (140 years of removal).  The CO2 concentration should then be held at 284.7 ppm for as long as possible (minimum 60 years) with all other forcing held constant at pre-industrial levels.  EMICs (Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity) and box models are encouraged to extend runs for at least 1000 years (max 5000 years) at 284.7 ppm CO2. Additional ensemble members are requested with tier 2 priority.",
