    "description": "Idealised equatorial eruption corresponding to an initial emission of 56.2 Tg of SO2. This eruption has a magnitude roughly corresponding to the 1815 Mt Tambora eruption in Indonesia, which was linked to the so-called \"year without a summer\" in 1816.  Maintain the same constant boundary forcing as the pre-industrial control integration, except for the volcanic forcing. The experiment will not account for the actual climate conditions when the real event occured (e.g., presence and strength of additional forcing factors). Instead, the experiment is designed to span very different initial climate states to systematically assess uncertainties in the post-eruption behaviour that are related to background climate conditions.  If, for instance, year Y of the control integration matches the desired conditions for the initial condition sampling, then the corresponding VolMIP simulation should start with restart data from year Y-1 of the control.  Run nine ensemble members for at least 20 years, but preferably longer (50 years) to cover the multi-decadal oceanic response. Initialisation date from the piControl start year is 1st April.",
