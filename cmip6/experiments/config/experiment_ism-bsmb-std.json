Apply a prescribed anomaly of basal melting rate under floating ice, provided by ISMIP6, which simulates a doubling of sub-ice-shelf melting after 40 years of simulation for models with initial melting rates close to today\u2019s observations. Keep the Surface Mass Balance (SMB) the same as in the ism-ctrl-std experiment.  All other model parameters and forcings are the same as those used for initialization.\nNeither SMB anomaly nor bedrock topography should be adjusted in response to ice-sheet geometric changes in this experiment. However, groups are encouraged to submit multiple \"physics\" ensemble members for example by changing the sliding law, stress balance approximation, model resolution, or datasets (such as using different bedrocks).",
