    "description": "Parallel experiment to volc-cluster-ctrl but with initial conditions taken from last-millennium simulation to account for the effects of a more realistic history of past natural forcing.  Initialisation on 1 January 1790 to avoid interferences due to the decadal drop of solar activity associated with the Dalton Minimum.  The first eruption of the cluster begins in 1809 as in volc-cluster-ctrl. All external forcings, except volcanic forcing, are set as a perpetual repetition of the year 1790 for the full duration of the experiment. At least one, preferably three, ensemble members.  69 years for each ensemble member.",
