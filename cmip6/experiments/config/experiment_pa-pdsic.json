Coupled model time slice constrained by climatological monthly mean sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice concentration (SIC) for the present day.  Sea ice concentration to be nudged into coupled model with a relaxation time-scale of 1 day. Radiative forcing to be set to present day (year 2000) levels. Initial conditions for coupled model experiments to be taken from year 2000 of coupled model CMIP6 historical simulations. Time slice simulations to begin on 1st April and run for 14 months, the first two months are ignored to allow for an initial model spin up. Minimum ensemble size is 100 simulations.",
