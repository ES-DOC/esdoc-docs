Tropospheric ozone should be fixed at 3D long-term monthly mean piControl values, with a value of 100 ppbv ozone concentration in this piControl climatology used to separate the troposphere from the stratosphere.   In models without coupled chemistry the same stratospheric ozone prescribed in SSP2-45 should be prescribed. Stratospheric ozone concentrations will be provided by CCMI.",
