The first eruption of the cluster begins in 2015. All external forcings, except volcanic forcing are from the 21st-century SSP2-4.5 scenario experiment of ScenarioMIP. At the end of the volcanic cluster, volcanic forcing input shall be kept constant at the same constant value prescribed for the piControl simulation for consistency with the SSP2-4.5 scenario experiment. At least one, preferably three ensemble members. 85 years for each ensemble member.",
