For optimal comparison between models, aerosol concentrations are recommended (rather than emissions).\nInitial conditions from the spinup-1950 experiment.\nAt least one ensemble member at high resolution, minimum atmosphere 25-50 km at mid-latitudes and ocean resolution of 0.25 degrees, and a minimum of daily coupling between ocean and atmosphere.\nAt least one ensemble member at standard model resolution.  \nRun for 100 years.",
