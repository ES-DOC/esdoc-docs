The forcing consists of greenhouse gases, including ozone and aerosol loading for a 1950s (~10 year mean) climatology.  For optimal comparison between models, aerosol concentrations would be preferable and not emissions.\nInitial ocean conditions are taken from the EN4 (Good et al, 2013) ocean analysis over an average period of 1950-1954.  A short spin-up with these forcings is required (~50 years) to produce initial conditions.\nAt least one ensemble member at high resolution, minimum atmosphere 25-50 km at mid-latitudes and ocean resolution of 0.25 degrees, and a minimum of daily coupling between ocean and atmosphere.\nAt least one ensemble member at standard model resolution.  \nRun for 100 years.",
