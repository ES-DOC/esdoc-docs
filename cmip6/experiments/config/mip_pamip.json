    "description": "Polar amplification - the phenomenon that external radiative forcing produces a larger change in surface temperature at high latitudes than the global average - is a key aspect of anthropogenic climate change, but its causes and consequences are not fully understood. The Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project seeks to improve our understanding of this phenomenon through a coordinated set of numerical model experiments.",
