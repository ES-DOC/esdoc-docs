    "description": "The HighResMIP equivalent of the pre-industrial spinup with fixed 1950s forcing. The forcing consists of greenhouse gases, including ozone and aerosol loading for a 1950s (~10 year mean) climatology. For optimal comparison between models, use of plume aerosol concentrations is recommended (rather than emissions).  \nInitial ocean conditions are taken from the EN4 (Good et al, 2013) ocean analysis over an average period of 1950-1954.  This spinup is short compared to DECK (30-50 years for example, to be manageable and consistent across resolutions) to produce initial conditions for control-1950 and hist-1950.\nAt least one ensemble member for each resolution used int he coupled simulations (i.e. standard and high), where high is minimum atmosphere 25-50 km at mod-latitudes and ocean resolution of 0.25 degrees, and a minimum of daily coupling between ocean and atmosphere.\nRun for 30-50 years.",
