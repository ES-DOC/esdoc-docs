The experiment is comprised of transient coupled atmosphere-ocean simulations in which a selection of land surface characteristics is prescribed rather than interactively calculated in the model.  The \"climatological\" land surface forcing is calculated as the mean annual cycle in the period 1980-2014 from the historical GCM simulations. Additional ensemble members are requested with tier 2 priority.",
