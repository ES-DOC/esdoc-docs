    "description": "Beginning from a preindustrial control simulation (picontrol) the net top of atmosphere (TOA) radiative flux imbalance due to an abrupt quadrupling of the CO2 concentration (abrupt4xCO2) would be balanced via a reduction in total solar irradiance. Here, \"balance\" is defined as  the global mean value of top-of-atmosphere net radiative flux being within \u00b10.1 W/m2 of the piControl experiment over an average of years 1-10 of the simulation. \nThe G1 experiment should be run for 50 years, however modelling groups that are not able to extend their previous (G1) model simulation should run the CMIP6 G1 experiment for the full 100 years.",
