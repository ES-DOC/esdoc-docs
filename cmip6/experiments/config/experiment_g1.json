    "description": "Extended version of GeoMIP experiment G1 (Kravitz et al., 2011).\nBeginning from a preindustrial control simulation (picontrol) the net top of atmospehere (TOA) radiative flux imbalance due to an abrupt quadruping of the CO2 concentration (abrupt4xCO2) would be balanced via a reduction in total solar irradiance. Here, \"balance\" is defined as  the global mean value of top-of-atmosphere net radiative flux being within \u00b10.1 W/m2 of the piControl experiment over an average of years 1-10 of the simulation. \nThe G1ext experiment should be run for 50 years, however modelling groups that are not able to extend their previous (G1) model simulation should run experiment G1ext for the full 100 years.",

    "rationale": "To assess extreme events and longer term climate varability in an idealized geoengineering scenario. G1ext will be highly synergistic with single-forcing experiments to be included in the Cloud Feedback MIP (CFMIP) in which total solar irradiance is abruptly increased or decreased. Through comparisons with the CFMIP experiments, G1ext will enable a better understanding of how the Earth System responds to radiative forcing.",
