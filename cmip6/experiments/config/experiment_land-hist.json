Include representation of land cover, land use and land management. All applicable land use features should be active. Forced with historical observed climate. Include all transient forcings that are relevant for the land model such as CO2 concentration, Nitrogen deposition, aerosol deposition, population density. Start year either 1850 or 1700 depending on standard practice for particular model. This experiment is shared with the LS3MIP, note that LS3MIP expects the start year to be 1850.   \nThis experiment can and likely will be a different configuration across models due to different representations of land use for each model.",
