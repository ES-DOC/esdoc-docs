    "description": "Idealised high-latitute (60N) eruption emitting 100 Tg of SO2 over five months. Maintain the same constant boundary forcing as the pre-industrial control integration, except for the volcanic forcing. The eruption's strength and length roughly correspond to that of the 1783-84 Laki eruption.  The experiment will not account for the actual climate conditions when the real event ocurred (e.g., presence and strength of additional forcing factors). Instead, the experiment is designed to span very different initial climate states to systematically assess uncertainties in the post-eruption behavior that are related to background climate conditions.  Run nine ensemble members for at least 20 years, but preferably longer (30-40 years) to cover the multi-decadal oceanic response.",

To investigate outstanding questions about the magnitude of the climatic impact of high-latitude eruptions.   Laki has a unique eruption style (large SO2 mass releases occurred at short temporal intervals). Due to the long emission period, results of this experiment may have implications for sulfate aerosol geo-engineering.",
