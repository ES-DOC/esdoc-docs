A stand-alone ice sheet model is initialized using a modelling groups' own initialisation technique.  ism-ctrl-std is an unforced forward experiment where the surface mass balance remains identical to the one used during the initialization procedure. The choice of model input data is unconstrained to allow participants the use of their preferred model setup without modification.",
