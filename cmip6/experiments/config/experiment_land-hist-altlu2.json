Note that land use in 1700 and 1850 will be different to that in land-hist so model will need to be spun up again for each alternative dataset. Use the same land model configuration as used in the coupled CMIP6 historical simulations. Include representation of land cover, land use and land management. All applicable land use features should be active. \nThis experiment can and likely will be a different configuration across models due to different representations of land use for each model.",
