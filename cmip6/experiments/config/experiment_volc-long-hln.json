    "description": "Idealised high-latitude (60N) northern hemisphere eruption corresponding to an initial emission of 28.1 Tg of SO2 (equal to half the total amount injected for volc-long-eq).  volc-long-hlN is not directly comparable to the 1783\u201384 Laki eruption since it does not try to reproduce the very specific characteristics of Laki. The experiment is designed to span very different initial climate states to systematically assess uncertainties in post-eruption behaviour that are related to background climate conditions.  If, for instance, year Y of the control integration matches the desired conditions for the initial condition sampling, then the corresponding VolMIP simulation should start with restart data from year Y-1 of the control.  Run nine ensemble members for at least 20 years, but preferably longer (50 years) to cover the multi-decadal oceanic response. Initialisation date from the piControl start year is 1st April.",
