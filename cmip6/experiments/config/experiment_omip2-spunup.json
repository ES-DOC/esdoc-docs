Another difference from omip2 is that the required simulation length is 5 cycles of the 61-year JRA55-do forcing.   \nThe spin up simulations may be made with the classic online or offline approach,\nor with tracer-acceleration techniques or fast solvers. If an online approach is used,\nat the end of the 5th cycle of the JRA55-do forcing, the model's physical fields\nshould be reinitialized to the values at the start of the 3rd cycle in order to avoid\nlong-term drift in those fields and to assure that they will not diverge greatly from\nphysical fields in the omip2 simulation. .   \nThe spin up also includes radiocarbon to evaluate deep-ocean circulation.",
