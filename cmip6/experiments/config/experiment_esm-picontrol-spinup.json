Conditions chosen to be representative of the period prior to the onset of large-scale industrialization, with 1850 being the reference year.  This experiment describes an initial climate spin-up, during which the climate begins to come into balance with the forcing.  To be performed with an Earth System Model (ESM) that can calculate atmospheric CO2 concentration and account for the fluxes of CO2 between the atmosphere, the ocean, and biosphere.  Run until Earth System reaches equilibrium.",
