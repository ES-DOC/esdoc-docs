Time slice forced by climatological monthly mean sea surface temperature (SST) for the present day and future Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) only in the Barents and Kara Seas. Radiative forcing to be set to present day (year 2000) levels. Future SIC will be computed from the ensemble of CMIP5 projections by PAMIP. Sea ice thickness should be specified according to the CMIP6 AMIP protocol. Time slice simulations to begin on 1st April and run for 14 months, the first two months are ignored to allow for an initial model spin up. Minimum ensemble size is 100 simulations.",
