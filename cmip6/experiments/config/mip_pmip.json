    "description": "PMIP is a suite of experiments that give insight into the behaviour of the climate system in the past and how it compares to present-day climate.  PMIP builds on simulations for CMIP5: last millennium (last 1000 years), the mid-Holocene (~6,000 years ago), the Last Glacial Maximum (~21,000 years ago) with two additional warm period simulations: the Last Interglacial (~127,000 years ago) and the mid-Pliocene (~3,200,000 years ago).",
