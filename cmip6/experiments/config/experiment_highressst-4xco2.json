HadISST2.2 sea surface temperature and sea ice concentrations at daily 1/4 degree resolution to be used (Kennedy et al. 2017, in prep). The CO2 concentration seen by the radiation scheme is quadrupled with respect to the CMIP6 amip experiment. If the carbon cycle remains active, it should continue to \"see\" highresSST-present CO2 concentrations.  For optimal comparison between models the use of plume aerosol cocentrations are recommended (rather than emissions).\nAt least one ensemble member at high resolution, minimum 25-50 km at mid-latitudes. Initial conditions from the highresSST-present experiment.",
