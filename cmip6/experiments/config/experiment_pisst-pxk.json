The magnitude of the uniform increase is taken from each model's global, climatological annual mean SST change between abrupt4xCO2 and the piControl (using the mean of years 111-140 of abrupt4xCO2, and the parallel 30-year section of piControl).  Atmospheric constituents and any other necessary boundary conditions (e.g. vegetation if required) taken from each model's own piControl simulation (using the 30 years of piControl that are parallel to years 111-140 of its abrupt4xCO2 run). Dynamic vegetation should be turned off and the vegetation distribution that is output from the piControl simulation used.",
