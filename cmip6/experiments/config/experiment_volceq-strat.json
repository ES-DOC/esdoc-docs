    "description": "1991 Pinatubo forcing is expressed with a prescribed pertubation to the total (LW+SW) radiative heating rates. Maintain the same constant boundary forcing as the pre-industrial control integration, except for the volcanic forcing. Requires special diagnostics of parameterised and resolved wave forcings, radiative and latent heating rates. The experiment will not account for the actual climate conditions when the real event ocurred (e.g., presence and strength of additional forcing factors). Instead, the experiment is designed to span very different initial climate states to systematically assess uncertainties in the post-eruption behavior that are related to background climate conditions. Run at least 25 ensemble members for 3 years.",
