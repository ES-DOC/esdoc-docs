The SST pattern anomaly is derived from years 91-140 of the model's own abrupt4xCO2 experiment, with respect to the piControl, and scaled to have a global mean increase of 4K. The SST pattern anomaly is to be expressed as seasonally varying monthly means.  The 4xCO2 increase is also seen by the radiation code and vegetation code.\nSame as futureSST, but CO2 is quadrupled, and the increase in CO2 is seen by both the radiation scheme and vegetation.",
