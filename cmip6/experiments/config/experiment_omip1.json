    "description": "Global ocean - sea-ice - coupled experiment forced with the CORE-II (Coordinated Ocean - ice Reference Experiments) inter-annually varying atmospheric and river data sets for years 1948-2009.  Initial ocean tracer fields are based on observations. Simulation length for at least 5 cycles of the 62-year forcing is required.\nThe 5-cycle length is recommended to facilitate intercomparison within the experiment \nby using a common simulation length, but a longer simulation length is also accepted.\nFor each simulation, set the beginning of the simulation (e.g., 1700 and 1638 for \nthe 5-cycle and 6-cycle simulation, respectively) as the \u2018base time\u2019 of the time axis.\nSimulations with different simulation lengths by a single model are treated as members \nof an ensemble. Thus, different 'realization' indexes (e.g., r1, r2, r3, ...) should be used\nin a global attribute named 'variant_index' (e.g., r1i1p1f1). It is requested that information relevant to understanding the differences in members of an ensemble of simulations is reported in a global attribute named 'variant_info'. This information should also be recorded in the ES-DOC documentation of each experiment performed by a model and be made available via the 'further_info_url'.\nAll Priority=1 OMIP diagnostics are requested for all cycles of the 62-year forcing \nto quantify drift. All OMIP diagnostics (Priority=1,2,3) are requested for the last cycle.",
