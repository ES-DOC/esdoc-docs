Branch from end of land-hist spin-up period and continue with spin-up forcing looping over the first 20 years of meteorological forcing data.  Use the same land model configuration as used in the coupled CMIP6 historical simulations. Include representation of land cover, land use and land management. All applicable land use features should be active. Start year either 1850 or 1700 depending on standard practice for particular model. \nThis experiment can and likely will be a different configuration across models due to different representations of land use for each model.",
