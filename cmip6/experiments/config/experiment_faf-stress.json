The surface flux anomalies are calculated from the ensemble mean of the CMIP5 1pctCO2 simulations at the time of CO2 doubling.  Surface flux anomalies (a function of longitude, latitude and time of year) are to remain constant throughout the experiment.  Note that the fluxes themselves are not replaced because this would typically cause a very large climate drift and possible instability. The stress perturbation is added to the momentum balance of the ocean water surface, it should not directly perturb any turbulent mixing scheme that depends on the windstress and should not be applied to the sea-ice momentum balance, although presumably the sea-ice velocity will be indirectly affected.",
