The scenario branches from SSP5-8.5, an unmitigated baseline scenario, at the beginning of 2040 when substantially negative net emissions are applied.  All non-CO2 forcing should be identical to that in the ScenarioMIP experiments: ssp534-over and ssp534-over-ext.\nIf computational resources are sufficient, the esm-ssp534-over simulation should be continued for at least another 1000 years with year 2300 forcing; i.e., the forcing is held constant at year 2300 levels as the simulation continues for as long as possible (up to 5000 years). Include all anthropogenic, solar, and volcanic forcing. Anthropogenic forcing includes aerosol emissions, non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions, and land use changes.  CO2 concentration calculated (i.e. emission driven).",
