Maintain the same constant boundary forcing as the pre-industrial control integration, except for the volcanic forcing. The experiment will not account for the actual climate conditions when the real event ocurred (e.g., presence and strength of additional forcing factors). Instead, the experiment is designed to span very different initial climate states to systematically assess uncertainties in the post-eruption behavior that are related to background climate conditions.  Run nine ensemble members for at least 20 years, but preferably longer (30-40 years) to cover the multi-decadal oceanic response.",
