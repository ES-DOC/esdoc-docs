    "description": "Abrupt-zero emissions experiment. Branch off  from the 1pctCO2 experiment with interactive CO2 (emissions-driven configuration) but with CO2 emissions set to zero. The branch off point is when the cumulative carbon emissions reach 1000 PgC.  Simulate the subsequent reduction in CO2 and change in climate for at least 100 years.  Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMICs) are requested to run longer simulations, up to 1000 years.  Note some Earth System Models (ESMs) may need to re-run an emissions-driven version of 1pctCO2 to branch-off from.",
