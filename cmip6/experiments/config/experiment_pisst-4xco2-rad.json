Other atmospheric constituents and any other necessary boundary conditions (e.g. vegetation if required) taken from each model's own piControl simulation (using the 30 years of piControl that are parallel to years 111-140 of its abrupt4xCO2 run). Dynamic vegetation should be turned off and the vegetation distribution that is output from the piControl simulation used.\nSame as piSST-control but CO2 as seen by the radiation scheme is quadrupled.",
